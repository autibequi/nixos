# Manual
me have bad memories

## Gnome
Mostly overwritten config are just to move the windows between screens and locating myself in worksapces without having to move my hand much.

Mostly workspace actions are <super> + something and windows actions are <super><alt> + something usually WASD

### Moving Workspaces
```
<super> a = move workspace left
<super> d = move workspace right
<super> w = overview
<super> s = Panel Menu
```

### Moving Windows
```
<alt> a/d - move window to left/right workspaces
```

### Misc
```
<super><shift>t = toggle dark/light mode
```

### Extensions
#### Tilling Assistant
```
<alt><shift> tab = fill all tiles
<alt><shift> a/d = move window to tile slots
<alt><shift> w = maximize
```

## Ghostty Manual
```
<ctr><shift> asdw = split detelas
<ctrl><shit> t = nova tab
<ctrl><shit> n = nova janela
```
